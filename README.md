# TASK - run instructions and a short description of my work

## note: you need install missing libraries. Framework is flask-restplus. 
flask-restplus support automatic swagger documentation...

https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL

For this task I was programming in anaconda - spyder (python 3.5.2) on windows 10

## run instructions:

1) in app.py file, you need to change your mysql connection parameters, it would better if parameters are in config file

2) run app.py file and go to url: http://localhost:5000/
    you will see swagger api spec

3) To test application just run test_unit.py, I could write init file some script that execute all tests in folder

## description of my work

It took me about 10 hours for programming and 8 hours for framework and literature
